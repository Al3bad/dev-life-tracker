## Dev Life Tracker Web App

 [DEMO PAGE](https://al3bad.github.io/dev-life-tracker/)

This single web page application has three main components:
- SCHEDULE: display all planned schedules from a calendar
- TASKS: display all the tasks/todos
- CODING ACTIVITY: display all the coding activities for the current week for a selected project

### Information you need to know

- All the presented data are predefined and won't change (except current time and date), but they are based on real data obtained from real APIs
- There is no back-end implementation for the demo version of this project, which means adding or deleting tasks won't be saved anywhere and any changes you made are only visible to you
- If you decided to inspect the code for the demo of this project, you may see things does not make sense. This is because the project was implemented first with back-end, then refined to be only front-end that shows the functionality of the website as if it was implemented with the back-end

### Ideas can/may be implemented for this project

- Select country/city to display its weather condition
- Adding interactive background in the header that describes the current condition of the weather
- Changing the colours (theme) based on the weather condition
- Adding more controls for the tasks; due date, category
